## 🎯 GRADUAL POPULATION WORKFLOW

### Option 1: As You Work
When you're in Perplexity and see content:
1. **Save/export** the file
2. **Drop it** in the appropriate folder
3. **Check off** the item in this list

### Option 2: Weekly Batch
Once a week:
1. **Spend 10 minutes** in Perplexity
2. **Grab 2-3 items** from the checklist
3. **Populate** the folders gradually

### Option 3: Priority-Based
Focus on high-value content first:
1. 🔴 **Legendary videos** first
2. 📚 **Book project** files second
3. 🎯 **Core projects** third
4. 📸 **Screenshots** when convenient
