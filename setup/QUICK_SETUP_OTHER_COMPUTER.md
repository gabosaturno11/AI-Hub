# üöÄ Quick Setup for Your OTHER Computer

## Copy & Paste These Commands (in order):

### Step 1: Run the Unification Script
```bash
cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/
./UNIFY_COMPUTERS.sh

Follow the prompts to authenticate through your browser.

cd ~/Projects
gh repo clone gabosaturno11/AI-Hub
```

### Step 4: Activate Your New Commands
