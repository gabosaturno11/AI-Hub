# AOC_MASTER Directory

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

This directory is a placeholder for the Art of Calisthenics master content.

The actual content is stored locally and not synced to GitHub for size and security reasons.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

When working locally, this directory contains:
- 01_COMMAND_CENTER
- 02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT
- 03_PRODUCTION_LINE
- 04_VISUAL_ARSENAL
- 05_STRATEGIC_ASSETS
- 06_ARCHIVE

## üîí Why This Directory is Empty on GitHub

1. **Size limitations** - The full content exceeds GitHub's file size limits
2. **Security** - Contains proprietary content and drafts
3. **Performance** - Keeps the repository lightweight and fast

## üí° For Developers

If you need access to the AOC_MASTER content:
1. Contact the repository owner
2. Content will be shared via secure file transfer
3. Store locally in your workspace (not in iCloud-synced folders)
