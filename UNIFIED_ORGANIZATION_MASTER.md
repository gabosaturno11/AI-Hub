# üéØ UNIFIED ORGANIZATION MASTER SYSTEM

## üîÑ THREE-WAY SYNC SYSTEM

**NEVER DELETE PRINCIPLE**: Organize, Create, Archive - NO DELETIONS

---

## üìç IDENTICAL STRUCTURE IN 3 LOCATIONS

### 1. AI Hub (Primary Development)
```
~/Projects/AI-Hub/AOC_MASTER/
```

### 2. Downloads (Active Sorting)
```
~/Downloads/AOC_MASTER/
```

### 3. Notion Databases (Under "Gabo Saturno HD")
```
Notion Workspace: Gabo Saturno HD
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_COMMAND_CENTER (Database)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT (Database)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_PRODUCTION_LINE (Database)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_VISUAL_ARSENAL (Database)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05_STRATEGIC_ASSETS (Database)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 06_ARCHIVE (Database)
```

## üéØ ORGANIZATION PROTOCOL

### SAFETY FIRST - NEVER DELETE
1. **ORGANIZE**: Sort existing content into structure
2. **CREATE**: New folders and systems as needed
3. **ARCHIVE**: Move old/duplicate content to 06_ARCHIVE/
4. **PRESERVE**: Keep all original timestamps and data

### Migration Rules
- **Duplicates**: Add "_duplicate_N" suffix ‚Üí 06_ARCHIVE/
- **Unknown files**: ‚Üí 06_ARCHIVE/Reference_Material/
- **Active work**: ‚Üí 03_PRODUCTION_LINE/Drafts/Current_Active/
- **Voice samples**: ‚Üí 02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT/GABO_VOICE_DNA/
- **Book content**: ‚Üí 02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT/BOOK_ARCHITECTURE/

## üöÄ CLAUDE DESKTOP COMMANDS FOR NOTION

### Clean Up Existing Databases
```
Review my Notion workspace "Gabo Saturno HD" and organize existing databases into the AOC_MASTER structure:

1. Create parent database "AOC_MASTER"
2. Organize existing databases under these 6 main categories:
   - 01_COMMAND_CENTER
   - 02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT
   - 03_PRODUCTION_LINE
   - 04_VISUAL_ARSENAL
   - 05_STRATEGIC_ASSETS
   - 06_ARCHIVE

3. NEVER DELETE existing databases - move them to appropriate categories
4. Archive any duplicates or old versions to 06_ARCHIVE
```

### Create Missing Structure
```
Create Notion databases for each AOC_MASTER folder that doesn't exist yet:

02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT:
- GABO_VOICE_DNA (database for voice samples, philosophies)
- BOOK_ARCHITECTURE (database for TOC, chapters, structure)
- CALISTHENICS_MASTERY (database for exercises, progressions)

03_PRODUCTION_LINE:
- Drafts (database for active writing)
- Ideas_Incubation (database for concepts, notes)
- Experimental_Content (database for testing)

And so on for all missing categories...
```

## üîÑ SYNC WORKFLOW

### Daily Workflow
1. **Work in Downloads** AOC_MASTER (active sorting)
2. **Sync to AI Hub** with `aocpush` command
3. **Update Notion** via Claude Desktop integration
4. **Commit to GitHub** for backup

### Commands to Create
```bash
# AOC-specific commands
alias aoc='cd ~/Projects/AI-Hub/AOC_MASTER'
alias aocdownloads='cd ~/Downloads/AOC_MASTER'
alias aocsync='rsync -av ~/Downloads/AOC_MASTER/ ~/Projects/AI-Hub/AOC_MASTER/'
alias aocpush='cd ~/Projects/AI-Hub && git add AOC_MASTER && git commit -m "AOC Master update" && git push'
alias aocnotion='claude --prompt "Sync AOC_MASTER changes to Notion databases"'
```
