# 🤖 Handoff Notes (Claude Code & Cursor)

**Date**: September 26, 2025
**From**: Claude Code Session
**To**: Cursor & Future Development

---

## 🎯 **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

### **📁 Asset Management:**
- **Keep asset paths relative** (`./assets/…`), **NOT absolute**
- Ensures portability across different deployment environments
- Prevents broken links when moved between domains/paths

### **🚀 Deployment Standards:**
- **Don't modify Pages/Vercel settings** - both repos are static and clean
- Keep deployment configurations minimal and standard
- Avoid complex build processes or server-side dependencies

### **🏗️ Repository Structure Standards:**

#### **saturno-writting-hub Structure:**
```
saturno-writting-hub/
├── index.html          ← Unified Hub (main entry point)
├── writing-hub.html    ← Writing App (core functionality)
├── assets/             ← All static assets (CSS, JS, images)
├── README.md           ← Documentation and usage
└── Makefile            ← Local development commands
```

### **🔍 Development Workflow:**
- **Use `rg` for searches** (ripgrep) - faster and more accurate than grep
- **Local serve via `make serve`** - standardized development server
- Keep consistent command patterns across all projects

### **✏️ Code Modification Philosophy:**
- **Keep edits surgical** - minimal, targeted changes only
- **Document all changes in README** - maintain clear change log
- Avoid large refactors that could break existing functionality
- Test changes locally before deployment

## 🎨 **CURRENT DESIGN SYSTEM**

### **Button Standards (Just Implemented):**
- Flat, minimalistic design
- Primary: Green (#00ff88) for main actions
- Secondary: Dark gray for support actions
- Left-aligned text with proper icon spacing
- Subtle hover effects (border color changes)

### **Color Palette:**
- **Primary Green**: #00ff88 (actions, highlights)
- **Background**: #0a0a0a to #1a1a1a gradient
- **Cards**: #222 with #333 borders
- **Text**: #e0e0e0 (primary), #999 (secondary)

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### **Before Any Deployment:**
1. Test all links and functionality locally
2. Verify asset paths are relative
3. Check responsive design on mobile
4. Validate HTML/CSS syntax
5. Test cross-browser compatibility

### **Git Workflow:**
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
- Use conventional commit format
- Always include "Generated with Claude Code" attribution
- Push to main branch triggers auto-deployment
