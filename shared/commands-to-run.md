### **Run This Command:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/AI-Hub
./scripts/aoc-reorganize.sh
```

### **What It Does:**
- Creates complete AOC_MASTER folder structure
- Intelligently moves your book folders:
  - **Voice samples** → `02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT/GABO_VOICE_DNA/`
  - **Active drafts** → `03_PRODUCTION_LINE/Drafts/Current_Active/`
  - **Exercise content** → `02_KNOWLEDGE_VAULT/CALISTHENICS_MASTERY/`
  - **Visual assets** → `04_VISUAL_ARSENAL/`
  - **Business docs** → `05_STRATEGIC_ASSETS/Business_Context/`

### **Safety Features:**
- ✅ **Interactive** - asks permission for each move
- ✅ **Preview** - shows source and destination
- ✅ **Safe** - won't overwrite existing files

### **When to Use:**
- Run on Downloads folder with book content
- Run on Desktop with scattered files
